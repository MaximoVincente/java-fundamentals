# Review

In this application we exercised inheritance to create a review application for a shop and a theater, where users can see the name, the number of stars, and dollar signs for price. 

Additionally, the user can add a review with the star rating, description, and their name.

For reviewing the theater, the user has the option to add the movie they saw.
